# LOAD PACKAGES ############################################

# I recommend "pacman" for managing add-on packages. It will
# install packages, if needed, and then load the packages.
install.packages("pacman")

# Then load the package by using either of the following:
require(pacman)  # Gives a confirmation message.
library(pacman)  # No message.

# Or, by using "pacman::p_load" you can use the p_load
# function from pacman without actually loading pacman.
# These are packages I load every time.
pacman::p_load(pacman, dplyr, GGally, ggplot2, ggthemes, ggvis, httr, lubridate, plotly, rio, rmarkdown, shiny, stringr, tidyr) 

library(datasets)  # Load/unload base packages manually

# CLEAN UP #################################################

# Clear packages
p_unload(dplyr, tidyr, stringr) # Clear specific packages
p_unload(all)  # Easier: clears all add-ons
detach("package:datasets", unload = TRUE)  # For base

# Clear console
cat("\014")  # ctrl+L

# Clear mind :)
